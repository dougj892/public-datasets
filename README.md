# public-datasets

This repo contains datasets I have created from other sources which may be useful to others. I have included some brief notes on each of the datasets below. 

## ASER trends over time

This dataset contains data from the 2014 publication "ASER Trends over Time."  In addition, I have also updated the file manually using data from the 2016 ASER report.

Note that this dataset was created by scraping the ASER Trends over Time using the Tabula tool and by manually entering data where Tabula was unable to import the tables from the pdf. Thus, there may be a few errors in the file. (If you find any let me know.)  I have done a bunch of spot checks and inspected every instance of a big jump from one year to the next in the data so hopefully coding errors should be relatively few.

## ASER 2018 and NAS 2017 govt school grade 3 reading

This dataset contains data from several ASER rounds on the proportion of rural grade 3 children attending govt schools who can read a std 2 level text. In addition, it contains data on the proportion of rural grade 3 children attending either govt or private aided schools who are reading at a grade 3 level. 

ASER data comes from table 5 of the ASER reports. NAS data comes from [this page](http://nas.schooleduinfo.in/dashboard/nas_ncert#/) on the NAS website. 

## State GDP per capita

Figures obtained from the RBI website.

## aser_district_all_6

ASER district data from 2006 to 2011. (ASER stopped releasing district figures as separate Excel files after 2011.) The dataset only contains data for the 406 districts for which I was able to get all 6 years of data.  It also only includes those variables which are available for each year.
